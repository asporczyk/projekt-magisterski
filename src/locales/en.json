      "blood-oxygen-level": "Blood oxygen level is a measure of how much oxygen the blood is carrying as a percentage of the maximum it could carry. It is an important indicator of the health of the body.",
      "blood-pressure": "Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. It consists of two values: systolic (upper) and diastolic (lower). The systolic pressure is the pressure when the heart pumps blood into the arteries, while the diastolic pressure is the pressure when the heart rests between beats. It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The optimal blood pressure is typically around 120/80 mmHg. High blood pressure (hypertension) can lead to serious health problems such as heart disease, kidney disease, or stroke, so it is important to monitor it and keep it at an appropriate level.",
      "blood-sugar": "Blood sugar level is the amount of glucose present in the blood of a human or animal. It is an important indicator of the health of the body.",
      "heart-rate": "Heart rate is the speed of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions of the heart per minute. It is an important indicator of the health of the body.",
      "mental-health": "Mental health is a level of psychological well-being, or an absence of mental illness. It is an important indicator of the health of the body.",
      "sleep": "Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced interactions with surroundings. It is an important indicator of the health of the body.",
      "temperature": "Body temperature is a measure of the body's ability to generate and get rid of heat. It is an important indicator of the health of the body."
